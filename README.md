### Project 1.1
* This program calculate the sum of the ASCII values of each character in the string declared in the .data area. The string is at least one word long, and only consists of alphabets and blanks.
* ex) string: "Hello World!"  ->  output: 1085

### Project 1.2
* This program calculates the product of all the digits of input of integer. The function of program work recursively, using a stack point.
* ex) input: 573  ->  output: 105

### Project 1.3
